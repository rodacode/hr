For this app I used create-react-app for the boilerplate of the app with React and Typescript. 
Added Chakra UI to speed up development of the UI.
As a mock of the backend I used Firebase Firestone.
Added a few toast messages after adding a new employee and deleting employee.
Also used tooltips on the icons hover for a better UX and guide the users a bit.

For future improvements:
 -add Redux as a state management
 -fix responsiveness on custom status component
 -improve styles theme

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
